# Music Recommendation System

A simple music recommendation system that combines content-based and popularity-based approaches to suggest songs based on user preferences and song features.

## Introduction

This project is a Python-based music recommendation system that leverages the Spotify API to provide song recommendations. It combines two recommendation techniques:

- Content-Based: Recommends songs based on their musical features.
- Hybrid: Combines content-based recommendations with popularity scores to provide a balanced recommendation approach.

## Features

- Authenticate with the Spotify API to access song data.
- Retrieve and preprocess data from a specific Spotify playlist.
- Generate content-based recommendations for songs.
- Combine content-based recommendations with a popularity-based score to provide hybrid recommendations.
- Detailed information about each song, including audio features and release date.
- Easy-to-use Python script for music enthusiasts.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Python 3.x installed on your local machine.
- Required Python libraries (requests, spotipy, pandas, scikit-learn) installed.
- A Spotify Developer account with a client ID and client secret for API authentication.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/music-recommendation-system.git
   cd music-recommendation-system
   
### Usage

To use the music recommendation system, follow these steps:

Authentication: Set your Spotify API client ID and client secret in the script.

Retrieving Playlist Data: Use the script to retrieve and preprocess data from a specific Spotify playlist, including song details, audio features, and release dates.

Content-Based Recommendations: Generate content-based recommendations by providing the name of a song. The system calculates song similarity based on audio features.

Hybrid Recommendations: Combine content-based recommendations with a popularity-based score to provide hybrid recommendations. Songs are ranked based on their musical similarity and popularity score.
